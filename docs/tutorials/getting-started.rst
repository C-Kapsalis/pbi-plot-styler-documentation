Getting started
===============

In this tutorial you will set up the field-parameter reporting pattern in
a Power BI (PBIP) project and use ``pbi-plot-styler`` to make its combo
charts presentation-ready. By the end you will have:

#. three field-parameter tables in your semantic model,
#. a combo-chart page driven by them, and
#. every chart styled by one command, and re-styled by the same command
   whenever the model changes.

The worked example is a small specialty-coffee roastery. Substitute your
own tables and measures as you go.

Prerequisites
----------------

- A Power BI project saved in PBIP format (a ``*.Report`` folder next to
  a ``*.SemanticModel`` folder, with TMDL enabled).
- Power BI Desktop (any recent version with field-parameter support).
- Python 3.10 or later with ``pbi-plot-styler`` installed:

::

    pip install .

Step 1: declare the measures, ``y-Plot Specific``
-----------------------------------------------------

A field parameter is a calculated table whose rows say "this field may
appear in this well". Create one named ``y-Plot Specific`` listing every
measure a combo chart should be able to display. In Power BI Desktop, use
Modeling, then New parameter, then Fields, or add the TMDL directly to
``definition/tables/y-Plot Specific.tmdl``:

::

    table 'y-Plot Specific'

        column 'y-Plot Specific'
            summarizeBy: none
            sourceColumn: [Value1]
            sortByColumn: 'y-Plot Specific Order'

            relatedColumnDetails
                groupByColumn: 'y-Plot Specific Fields'

        column 'y-Plot Specific Fields'
            isHidden
            summarizeBy: none
            sourceColumn: [Value2]
            sortByColumn: 'y-Plot Specific Order'

            extendedProperty ParameterMetadata =
                    {
                      "version": 3,
                      "kind": 2
                    }

        column 'y-Plot Specific Order'
            isHidden
            formatString: 0
            summarizeBy: sum
            sourceColumn: [Value3]

        partition 'y-Plot Specific' = calculated
            mode: import
            source =
                    {
                        ( "Bags Sold #", NAMEOF ( [Bags Sold #] ), 10, "sales_y" ),
                        ( "Revenue", NAMEOF ( 'Sales Measures'[Revenue] ), 20, "sales_y" ),
                        ( "Avg Cupping Score", NAMEOF ( [Avg Cupping Score] ), 30, "quality_y" ),
                        ( "Wholesale Margin %", NAMEOF ( 'Sales Measures'[Wholesale Margin %] ), 40, "sales_y" )
                    }

Each tuple is ``( display name, NAMEOF ( measure ), sort ordinal,
category )``. ``NAMEOF`` is what makes the pattern robust: it is a
reference, not a string, so renaming a measure updates the parameter
automatically. The fourth column lets you group measures in slicers; the
styler ignores it.

Two conventions worth keeping:

- Space out the ordinals (10, 20, 30, and so on) so you can insert later
  without renumbering.
- Comment out retired measures (``--`` or ``//``) instead of deleting
  them. The history stays readable, and the styler knows to skip them.

Step 2: declare the dimensions, ``x-Plot Specific 1`` and ``2``
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Repeat the exercise for dimensions. ``x-Plot Specific 1`` holds what a
chart can be sliced by on its axis; ``x-Plot Specific 2`` holds what it
can be split by in the legend:

::

        partition 'x-Plot Specific 1' = calculated
            mode: import
            source =
                    {
                        ( "Month", NAMEOF ( 'Calendar'[Month] ), 10, "time_x" ),
                        ( "Quarter", NAMEOF ( 'Calendar'[Quarter] ), 20, "time_x" ),
                        ( "Origin Country", NAMEOF ( 'Beans'[Origin Country] ), 30, "bean_x" ),
                        ( "Roast Level", NAMEOF ( 'Beans'[Roast Level] ), 40, "bean_x" )
                    }

::

        partition 'x-Plot Specific 2' = calculated
            mode: import
            source =
                    {
                        ( "Channel", NAMEOF ( 'Orders'[Channel] ), 10, "order_x" ),
                        ( "Brew Method", NAMEOF ( 'Orders'[Brew Method] ), 20, "order_x" )
                    }

The surrounding column definitions are identical to step 1 (rename
``y-Plot Specific`` accordingly).

Step 3: build the combo-chart page
----------------------------------------

On a new report page:

#. Add a line and clustered column chart.
#. Bind its wells to the parameters: X-axis from ``x-Plot Specific 1``,
   Legend from ``x-Plot Specific 2``, Column y-axis from
   ``y-Plot Specific``. For a comparison line, put a second measure from
   ``y-Plot Specific`` on the Line y-axis.
#. Add three slicers, one per parameter table, so viewers choose what is
   plotted.
#. Optionally, save bookmarks for the slicer combinations you present
   most. Each bookmark now replaces what used to be a dedicated page.

Save the project so the PBIP folders are up to date.

.. note::

   One measure, one axis. Avoid projecting the same measure on both the
   column and the line axis. Power BI applies per-measure formatting only
   once per visual and cannot disambiguate axes, so the second projection
   falls back to default rendering. Use a distinct wrapper measure
   instead.

Step 4: preview the styling
-------------------------------

From the folder that contains your PBIP project:

::

    pbi-plot-styler "Roastery.Report" --dry-run

You get a unified diff of every ``visual.json`` the styler would rewrite:

::

    Model:    .../Roastery.SemanticModel
    Measures: 4 drive the styling

    --- definition/pages/monthlyperformance/visuals/combo01/visual.json
    +++ definition/pages/monthlyperformance/visuals/combo01/visual.json (styled)
    ...
    2/2 visual(s) would change.

Nothing has been written yet; dry-run exits with code 1 to signal drift,
which also makes it a ready-made CI gate.

Step 5: apply
-----------------

::

    pbi-plot-styler "Roastery.Report"

::

      styled definition/pages/monthlyperformance/visuals/combo01/visual.json
      styled definition/pages/seasonaltrends/visuals/combo02/visual.json

    Restyled 2/2 visual(s); 0 already styled.

Open the report in Power BI Desktop: every measure the field parameters
expose now renders with the same line color, and its data labels sit on
a readable background. Run the command again and it reports
``Restyled 0/2 visual(s)``; the operation is idempotent.

Step 6: make it yours
-------------------------

Drop a ``plotstyler.toml`` next to your project and pick your brand
colors:

::

    [style]
    line_color = "#7A4419"
    label_color = "#FFF8F0"
    label_transparency = 30

::

    pbi-plot-styler "Roastery.Report" --zip roastery-styled.zip

The ``--zip`` flag additionally emits the styled report folder as an
archive you can hand to whoever publishes it.
